# Automated-SQL-Query-Generation-and-Optimization-Using-LLM

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on automating SQL tasks. The notebook demonstrates various SQL operations, automations, and integrations with Python to enhance data manipulation and analysis workflows.

## Contents

- **Automated__SQL.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook showcasing the automation of SQL tasks using Python. This includes examples of connecting to databases, executing queries, and processing results programmatically.
- **input_questions.txt**: A text file containing natural language questions to be converted into SQL queries.
- **database.db**: An SQLite database file used by the notebook to store and query data.
- **Output Files**: The results of the queries are saved in text files named `Question1.txt` to `Question6.txt`.

## Features

- **Database Connections**: Learn how to connect to different types of databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) using Python libraries.
- **SQL Query Automation**: Execute SQL queries directly from the notebook and automate repetitive tasks.
- **Data Analysis**: Integrate SQL query results with Python data analysis libraries such as pandas for further processing and visualization.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage database connection issues and query failures gracefully.

## Requirements

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.x
- Relevant Python libraries (e.g., `pandas`, `sqlalchemy`, `sqlite3`, `openai`)
