              Question 5              
========================================

Question:
Display the names of employees whose first and last names start with the same letter.

Generated SQL Query:
SELECT FirstName,
       LastName
FROM employees
WHERE SUBSTR(FirstName, 1, 1) = SUBSTR(LastName, 1, 1);

Query Results:
('Robert', 'Rodriguez')
('Thomas', 'Taylor')

Optimization Suggestions:

1. USE an INDEX ON the FirstName
   AND LastName columns TO speed up the SEARCH
   FOR matching FIRST characters. 2. INSTEAD OF USING the SUBSTR FUNCTION IN the
   WHERE clause,
   consider creating a computed COLUMN that stores the FIRST CHARACTER OF the FirstName
   AND LastName columns. This can improve the query performance BY avoiding the need TO calculate the substrings
   FOR EACH ROW during the query execution. 3.
   LIMIT the number OF columns being selected TO ONLY the necessary ones (FirstName
   AND LastName IN this CASE) TO REDUCE the amount OF DATA being processed. 4. Consider USING the LIKE
   OPERATOR WITH a pattern MATCH
   FOR the FIRST CHARACTER INSTEAD OF SUBSTR
   FOR potentially better performance:
   WHERE FirstName LIKE CONCAT(LastName, '%')
