              Question 3              
========================================

Question:
Find all employees who were hired in the year 2019.

Generated SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE strftime('%Y', HireDate) = '2019';

Query Results:
(6, 'David', 'Jones', 38, 'Engineering', 'Manager', 95000, '2019-09-17', 1)
(14, 'Richard', 'Gonzalez', 42, 'Engineering', 'DevOps', 95000, '2019-09-17', 6)

Optimization Suggestions:

1. Utilize indexing: Make sure that there IS an INDEX ON the HireDate COLUMN TO improve the SEARCH performance. 2. USE a
   MORE SPECIFIC date RANGE: IF you ARE ONLY looking
   FOR employees hired IN 2019,
   you can specify a
   MORE narrow date RANGE IN the
   WHERE clause.
   FOR example,
   WHERE HireDate >= '2019-01-01'
   AND HireDate < '2020-01-01'. 3. Avoid USING functions IN the WHERE clause: USING functions like strftime IN the WHERE clause can be costly IN terms OF performance. INSTEAD,
   consider preprocessing the DATA TO EXTRACT the YEAR
   FROM HireDate
   AND store it IN a separate column. 4. REDUCE the number OF columns retrieved: INSTEAD OF USING
   SELECT *,
   ONLY
   SELECT the
