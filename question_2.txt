              Question 2              
========================================

Question:
Who is the youngest employee in the Engineering department?

Generated SQL Query:
SELECT FirstName,
       LastName
FROM employees
WHERE Department = 'Engineering'
ORDER BY Age ASC
LIMIT 1;

Query Results:
('Jane', 'Doe')

Optimization Suggestions:

1. ADD an INDEX ON the 'Department'
   AND 'Age' columns IN the 'employees' TABLE TO improve the performance OF the
   WHERE clause
   AND
   ORDER BY clause. 2. USE a covering INDEX that includes the 'FirstName'
   AND 'LastName' columns IN addition TO the 'Department'
   AND 'Age' columns TO avoid accessing the actual TABLE DATA
   AND speed up the query. 3. Consider USING a
   MORE SPECIFIC COLUMN datatype
   FOR the 'Department' field,
   such AS an ENUM
   OR VARCHAR WITH a limited LENGTH,
   TO optimize
   STORAGE
   AND indexing. 4. Avoid USING wildcard characters IN the
   WHERE clause IF possible, AS it can slow down the query performance. INSTEAD,
   be AS SPECIFIC AS possible WITH the conditions. 5. Make sure STATISTICS ARE up TO
