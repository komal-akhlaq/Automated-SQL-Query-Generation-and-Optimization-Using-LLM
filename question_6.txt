              Question 6              
========================================

Question:
Find the employee with the highest salary in each department

Generated SQL Query:
SELECT Department,
       FirstName,
       LastName,
       MAX(Salary) AS HighestSalary
FROM employees
GROUP BY Department;

Query Results:
('Engineering', 'Jane', 'Doe', 95000)
('HR', 'Emily', 'Johnson', 70000)
('Management', 'Alex', 'Johnson', 200000)
('Marketing', 'Michael', 'Brown', 80000)
('Sales', 'John', 'Smith', 85000)

Optimization Suggestions:

1. Indexing: Ensure that the 'Department' COLUMN IN the 'employees' TABLE IS indexed TO help speed up the GROUPING process. 2.
   LIMIT the columns returned: IF you DO NOT need ALL the columns IN the OUTPUT,
   ONLY
   SELECT the columns that ARE necessary
   FOR the query TO REDUCE the amount OF DATA that needs TO be processed. 3. USE a subquery: IF the 'Salary' COLUMN IS indexed,
   you can USE a subquery TO FIRST find the maximum salary
   FOR EACH department
   AND THEN
   JOIN this RESULT back TO the 'employees' TABLE TO retrieve the
   CORRESPONDING employee information. 4. USE appropriate DATA types: Make sure the DATA types OF the columns IN the 'employees' TABLE ARE appropriate
   FOR the DATA they ARE storing. USING
